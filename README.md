# Turtle Race Game

This is a simple turtle race game built using Python's `turtle` module. In this game, six turtles of different colors race across the screen, and the user can bet on which turtle will win the race.

## Features

- Six turtles of different colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple).
- User can place a bet on which turtle they think will win the race.
- Randomized turtle movements to make the race unpredictable and exciting.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the `turtle` module if it is not already installed. The `turtle` module is included in the standard Python library, so no additional installation is typically needed.

## Usage

1. Download the code and save it to a file, e.g., `turtle_race.py`.
2. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python turtle_race.py
   ```

3. A window will pop up prompting you to place your bet by entering the color of the turtle you think will win the race.
4. Watch the race and see if your bet was correct!

## Code Explanation

- **Setup the Screen:**
  ```python
  screen = Screen()
  screen.setup(width=500, height=400)
  user_bet = screen.textinput(title="Make your bet", prompt="Which turtle will win the race? Enter a color: ")
  ```

- **Create Turtles:**
  Six turtles are created with different colors and positioned at the starting line:
  ```python
  colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]
  y_positions = [-70, -40, -10, 20, 50, 80]
  all_turtles = []

  for turtle_index in range(0, 6):
      new_turtle = Turtle(shape="turtle")
      new_turtle.penup()
      new_turtle.color(colors[turtle_index])
      new_turtle.goto(x=-230, y=y_positions[turtle_index])
      all_turtles.append(new_turtle)
  ```

- **Start the Race:**
  The race begins if the user has placed a bet:
  ```python
  if user_bet:
      is_race_on = True
  ```

- **Race Logic:**
  Each turtle moves forward by a random distance in each iteration of the race:
  ```python
  while is_race_on:
      for turtle in all_turtles:
          if turtle.xcor() > 230:
              is_race_on = False
              winning_color = turtle.pencolor()
              if winning_color == user_bet:
                  print(f"You've won! The {winning_color} turtle is the winner!")
              else:
                  print(f"You've lost! The {winning_color} turtle is the winner!")

          rand_distance = random.randint(0, 10)
          turtle.forward(rand_distance)
  ```

- **End the Game:**
  The game window stays open until the user clicks to close it:
  ```python
  screen.exitonclick()
  ```
